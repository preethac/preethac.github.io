                      She graduated with her M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.udel.edu/">University of Delaware </a> in 2016, and her Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.udel.edu/">University of Delaware </a> in 2021,
                      advised by <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~pollock/"> Dr. Lori Pollock </a>. Her research interests are primarily in software engineering, with an emphasis on improving software engineers’ tools and environments through data mining, text analysis and machine learning. She is especially interested in mining software repositories at a large scale, extending data analytics solutions to transform the plethora of information available in software artifacts into actionable nuggets of knowledge and tools, useful for both software engineers and researchers. Through her research, she intends to enable advances in areas including building/enhancing recommender systems for developers, information retrieval tasks from unstructured developer communications, and virtual assistants for software engineers.

                       <b>Overview of My Research:</b>
                       My research interests are primarily in software engineering, with an emphasis on improving software engineers tools and environments through data mining, text analysis and machine learning. I am especially interested in mining software repositories at a large scale, extending data analytics solutions to transform the plethora of information available in software artifacts into actionable nuggets of knowledge and tools, useful for both software engineers and researchers. I am also broadly interested in empirical software engineering.
