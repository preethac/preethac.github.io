                    Below is a brief description of my current and past research projects. <br><br>
                    <!--<h3 >Brief Overview:</h3> Integrated development environments today include sophisticated program modeling and analyses behind the scenes to support the developer in navigating, understanding, and modifying their code. While much can be learned from the results of static and dynamic analysis of their source code, developers also look to others for advice and learning. As software development teams are more globally distributed and the open source community has grown, developers rely increasingly on written documents (e.g., chats, Q&A forums) for help they might have previously obtained through in-person conversations. My research activities cover (a) conducting empirical studies to analyze the information in written documents of software archives, and (b) designing techniques to mine useful information from the software archives which could be used to support software teams, and in building/improving software maintenance and evolution tools.
                    Some of my research projects are: </br> </br>-->

                    <li> <b>Improving LLM-Assisted Bug Resolution: </b>
                    Our research explores ways to enhance software bug resolution using large language models (LLMs). We analyze developer-LLM interactions to identify effective communication patterns and develop tools for refining prompts. Additionally, we investigate methods to help LLMs generate accurate bug fixes by leveraging key contextual information from real-world issue reports. This work aims to advance AI-driven tools for reliable and efficient debugging.
                    <br>
                    </li>

                    <li> <b>Security Assessment of LLM-Generated Code: </b>
                      Our research investigates the security risks associated with LLM-generated code and related information. We also evaluate LLMs' ability to detect and explain vulnerabilities in code examples. This work aims to uncover risks in LLM-assisted software development and inform the design of safer AI-guided code generation tools. 

                    <!--
                    <li> <b> Understanding and Improving the Use of Conversational LLMs in Software Engineering: </b>
                      Conversational LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, Claude) have emerged as a pivotal resource for programming support, providing immediate assistance that enhances productivity and simplifies the learning process for developers. These models are particularly valued for allowing software developers to interact in natural language, supporting an interactive learning experience. Despite their popularity, conversational LLMs often omit crucial details or produce incorrect solutions, which are hard or time-consuming for developers to identify. We found several instances where these conversational LLMs suggest fabricated information (e.g., non-existent APIs) or omit warnings about potential security risks in their code suggestions.
                      Our research aims to improve software quality and developer productivity by providing comprehensive support for developers using conversational LLMs.

                    <li> <b> Mining Emotions from  Software Engineering Communication: </b>
                      Emotions can strongly impact activities that are collaborative in nature and require creativity and problem-solving skills, such as software development. Research has shown that positive emotions (e.g., Joy) are associated with increased productivity and
                    job satisfaction in software engineering teams. On the other hand, negative emotions (e.g., Frustration) can cause developers to lose motivation and exhibit lower participation, ultimately leading to team attrition. In this project, we aim to mine emotions and affect in software related text towards improving collaboration and productivity in software projects.

                      Popular chat platforms such as Slack host public chat communities that focus on specific software development topics such as Python or Ruby-on-Rails.
                      Many of those chat communications contain valuable information, such as description of code snippets and APIs, opinions on good programming practices, and causes of common errors/exceptions.
                      This project aims to develop analyses for automatically identifying and extracting information in developers’ chat communications towards improving and building new tools to support software engineers.

                    <li> <b> Studying Developer Focus on Question and Answer (Q&A) Forums : </b>
                      Although popular Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow serve as a good knowledge resource, the abundance of information can cause developers to spend considerable time in identifying relevant answers and suitable fixes. This project aims to help developers identify informative code and text from Q&A forums, once they have narrowed down their search to a post relevant to their task.

                    <li><b> Learning about Code Snippet Characteristics in Software Artifacts: </b>
                      Large corpora of software-related artifacts (e.g., blogs, bug reports, emails) offer the unique opportunity to learn from developers’ discussion about code snippets.  The goal of this project is to gain insight into the potential value and difficulty of mining the natural language text associated with the code snippets found in a variety of software-related documents, including blog posts, API documentation, code reviews, and public chats.

                    <li> <b> Mining Source Code Descriptions from Research Articles: </b>
                      Digital libraries of computer science research articles can be a rich source for code examples that are used to motivate or explain particular concepts or issues. In this project, we designed a technique to automatically identify natural language descriptions of code segments embedded within articles. Extracting these natural language descriptions alongside code could enable new advances in areas including code-based search, automatic code comment generation, and documentation generation.
